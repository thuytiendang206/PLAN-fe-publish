                            As Kate locks the shutters on her convenience store after another successful day, the past
                            worries of how to support her family and turbulent times can feel like a distant memory,
                            echoes from a different life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kate was married at 15 after falling pregnant, becoming a mother at just 16. Being forced
                            into marriage when she was still a child brought sudden strains and pains to Kate and her
                            husband. She quit school and started a family. She lived at the edge of poverty. But then
                            things brightened. Through workshops, training and grants, Plan International Philippines
                            helped Kate become an entrepreneur. Now she dreams of one day graduating from college.

                    Because of a lack of comprehensive sexuality education in secondary schools throughout the
                    Philippines, many girls and boys like Kate and her husband are unaware of the challenges
                    they will face when they marry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the <strong>legal age of marriage in the Philippines is 18</strong>, reports suggest
                    <strong>2 percent of women aged 25-49 are married by the time they reach 15.</strong>
                    Due to traditional gender stereotypes and roles, girls in many communities are often forced
                    to marry young, leave school and begin a life of work, motherhood, and domesticity.
                </p>
                <img src="images/icon_2_cambodia_2.gif" alt="icon_2_cambodia_2">
                <p>
                    This was true in Kate’s coastal community, where many young women marry and fall pregnant
                    far too early. Families rely on fishing and farming as the main source of income, education
                    and the wellbeing of girls are often not deemed as a priority.</p>
                <p>
                    School dropout is an issue that affects all adolescents regardless of sex. Yet, a study by
                    Plan International Philippines suggests most married girls are forced to discontinue their
                    studies because of feelings of embarrassment and shame - especially among those girls whose
                    child marriages were not voluntary - or because of their new responsibilities as wives and
                    mothers. A lack of financial resources can also push girls to drop out of school early.

                            It was the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic that pushed her to make a change.</strong> She decided
                            she had to pursue education once more. She began by attending a workshop on community-based
                            enterprise development conducted by Plan International Philippines’ Reach Mindanao Project,
                            part of the <strong>Youth Economic Empowerment Program.</strong> There, Kate learned about
                            creating business proposals, managing finances, and running a small enterprise. Armed with
                            new skills and inspired by the other young women in the workshop, Kate decided to put her
                            new entrepreneurial skills to work and begin her own business.
