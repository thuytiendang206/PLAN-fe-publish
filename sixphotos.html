                    remote areas.
                    Most are unaware of the challenges under-age newlyweds face. Usually, in Mai and Lua’s village,
                    <strong>girls get married between 14-15 years old,</strong> sometimes even earlier.

                    Mai and Lua managed to resist marriage until age 17. However, inevitable pressure from their
                    families and the community, name-calling and ostracization, and a future already mapped out for
                    girls like Mai would soon be enough to compel them into a hasty marriage.

                            and helping her husband’s family with their farm. Soon after marriage, Mai gave birth to the

                            decisions about whether to change hairstyles required permission.

                        where they can safely tell their own stories and learn how they can break down barriers and

                        potential to do amazing things too,” said Lua. “As men, we can be a great source of support for
                        girls and women. We can make meaningful contributions to the work girls are doing to feel
